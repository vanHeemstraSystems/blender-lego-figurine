# 200 - Importing the LEGO Figurine from Mecabricks into Blender

Based on "How to Install the Blender Add on for Mecabricks - YouTube" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UTBY03wGmU

Based on "How To Make A Lego Animation In Blender (2023 Updated) | Part 1 - Models" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gzv2HKAyS4

**NOTE**: Instead of using a self-made LEGO Figurine from Mecabricks, that needs rigging in Blender, we can buy ($30.00) a MecaFig (see https://www.mecabricks.com/en/shop/product/5) directly from Mecabricks that is ready to be used in Blender and is already fully rigged. See [How To Use MecaFig | Mecabricks Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=IyJliZ-hfYY).

We will use the above-mentioned MecaFig plugin for Blender following the tutorial, and apply th rig to our previously created LEGO Figurine, so we have the best of both worlds: Easy and Speed of Rigging with a Customized Figure!
