## 100 - Purchase MecaFig from Mecabricks shop

**NOTE**: Instead of using a self-made LEGO Figurine from Mecabricks, that needs rigging in Blender, we can buy ($30.00) a MecaFig (see https://www.mecabricks.com/en/shop/product/5) directly from Mecabricks that is ready to be used in Blender and is already fully rigged. See [How To Use MecaFig | Mecabricks Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=IyJliZ-hfYY).

We will use the above-mentioned MecaFig plugin for Blender following the tutorial, and apply the rig to our previously created LEGO Figurine, so we have the best of both worlds: Easy and Speed of Rigging with a Customized Figure!

So go ahead and buy [MecaFig from the Mecabricks Shop](https://www.mecabricks.com/en/shop/product/5) and download the zipped file to your computer. Memorize where you downloaded it to for later use.

## 200 - Install Blender

Go to blender.org, do **not** go to blender.com. Go to the [download page](https://www.blender.org/download/) and click **Download Blender *version***. Choose the edition that matches with your Operating System (OS).

Once downloaded, install Blender.

When Blender is installed, the **Quick Setup** will present you with a couple of setup options (such as language, shortcuts, select with, spacebar, and theme). It is recommended to leave the defaults, and click **Next**. And then open up a *New File* of type **General**.

## 300 - Set Preferences in Blender

With the new file opened in Blender, go to **Edit** and **Preferences**.

Let's start with some Add-ons. Click **Add-ons** from the left-hand menu of the Blender Preferences window.

Click **Install** and go to the location on your computer where you previously downloaded the **MecaFig** zipped folder to. Click on the zipped folder and choose **Install Add-on**.

Now that we have installed it, we need to enable it. In the **Search** textfield of the Blender Preferences window, type ```MecaFig``` and hit ENTER to get it listed.

Make sure to check the checkbox in front of **3D View - MecaFig** so it is enabled.
