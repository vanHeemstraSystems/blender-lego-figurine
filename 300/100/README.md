**TIP**: To get an idea of different LEGO minifigures as they are called, see https://www.mecabricks.com/en/library/minifigs

**TIP**: To see a finished LEGO Figurine, followed below instructions, see ```Figurine``` at https://www.mecabricks.com/en/account/library.

**NOTE**: To save a custom LEGO minifig, it is recommended to save it as *MOC*, not *LEGO minifig*. LEGO minifig is only for official minifigs.
